**Pods is a development framework for creating, extending, managing, and deploying customized content types in WordPress.**

## 3.0 Is In Development & Is Not Functional
Please only use this branch to contribute to development. If you are developing you <strong>must run composer update</strong> before use. Once we reach beta we will provide regular builds for easy testing. In the meantime, you must have Composer installed and before use, run either:

`composer update` <-- Install with unit tests. Must have test suite installed first.

`composer update --no-dev` <-- Install without tests.
